# *Student-Buddy*

# Learn with AI - Your personal study Application, to visualize, to summarize and gain the concept at glance using AI. 

# Inspiration:

- Today's world requires every individual to have knowledge of all educational fields like science, economics, history, art, etc. But is it really possible to learn all the educational terms in such short schooling time, when one requires to use the concepts in the real world to have real experience, we should learn efficiently.

- To make the education and learning process efficient. 

- To provide fun and stress free learning.

- With the advances in AI to exploit the capability of generative AI.

- As we see the growth in digital learning and students getting acclimatize to use online platform to study concepts, this web application is based on using AI to make learning simple ðŸ’¯ 


# What it does:

- This AI powered web application helps in Learning by providing some services -

- This AI tool makes tough concept and difficult terms easy to understand by providing a pictorial representation of the concept description. It converts the textual explanation of concept or any definition to create a picture or diagram.

- The other AI function helps in getting short notes and makes the long paragraphs and time taking texts easy to learn.

- More AI powered educational tools like get help in coding by having a tool to translate programming language, get complexity of code, getting grammar correction and suggestion, And other AI tool to get questions generated from the content text provided.

# How we built it:

- Choosing a generative AI API
- Defining Use case for Web application
- Setting up development environment
- Integrating API with Web Flask
- Deploying the Application

# Challenges we ran into:
- Integrating many API and multiple files to Web application.
- Handling multiple files together.
- Deploying model and integrating with flask.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of:
- We were able to achieve the solution we planned to make for creating the Web application which works based on generative AI.
- These AI powered Application  can make Learning super efficient. And prove to be a real assistant for education.

# What we learned:
- Generative AI working and its application
- How are REST APIs made
- To integrate the API and Web Application
- Deploying Web application and model.

# What's next for Student Buddy:

- Generative AI is proving to shape AI trend and give rise to many industry based on AI powered application. We believe our idea to solve many learning problems and provide a tool which can make learning efficient, more importantly reduce stress of students.
- To achieve it and scale the product we believe a live web application based on secure server can be made and a final service based product can be launched in market for use of consumers. This model can be based on subscription service.
